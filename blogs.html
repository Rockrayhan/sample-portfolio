    <!--=========== CSS specificity =========== -->

            <h1 class="article-header">CSS Specificity</h1>

            <p>
                CSS Specificity is one of the most common and important topics of CSS. Also a very confusing topic and a
                confusing word. People often get confused about this concept, especially beginners. Before we talk about
                SpecificityIt is important we know what cascading is in the cascading style sheet. So, cascading
                actually means your style is being passed down from top to bottom. Also, one thing to know is that since
                our styleSheet is being read from top to bottom if we have two identical styles being applied to the
                same element, the last one gets applied by the browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                There is some math involved with specificity and certain types of selectors have certain value points
                attached to them and whatever selector has the most value wins and gets applied. When you have
                conflicting styles that are styling the same element or elements CSS actually assigns a numeric
                specificity value. It calculates a number to see which one wins. The winner element is more specific
                than others.

            </p>
            <p>
                One of the most annoying things in web development is when you write some CSS styles sometimes they just
                don’t work. When you check them in the dev tool you will find that the styles you have made are crossed.
                It happens because of CSS specificity.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you use more than one CSS style set in an element, the browser will allow only one. The rule that
                browsers follow to use CSS style set in orderly is called CSS specificity. CSS specificity always works
                priority-wise. Here is the priority order:
                Inline (2) Id (3) Class (4) Internal CSS (5) External CSS (6) tag

                Inline: Styling your element using inline CSS is the most powerful and higher ranked in CSS specificity

                ID: Id selectors are very very specific but less ranked than the inline style.

                Class: They are pretty specific but not as specific as ID because you use each id is unique and each id
                is used for each element on the other hand one class can be used in many elements. So the class has
                fewer scores than ID.

                Internal CSS: You can use inline CSS on the same page you are coding or developing your site. In the
                head tag you have to give another tag. In the style tag you can do all your styles. But that style will
                only be used for that particular page. So it became more particular than external CSS.

                External CSS: Inline CSS can be used on only one page that you are coding. But you can use external CSS
                in as many pages as you want so that’s why external CSS is less specific than internal CSS.

                Tag: You can style your tags by calling them in the Internal or external style sheet. That’s why they
                are at the last ranked in the CSS specificity.

                    <p>
                        <b>charAt:</b> CharAt() returns the character at the specific position. When you want to know a
                        character’s index position you can use charAt(). <br> Example: let text = "HELLO WORLD"; <br>
                        let letter = text.charAt(1); The Result will be E.
                    </p>

                </li>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Concat:</b> When you want to join two or more strings into a new variable you can use
                        concat()
                        method. <br>
                        Example: let word1 = “Hello” ; <br> let word2 = “world” : <br> let result = word1.concat( “ ”,
                        word2 ) ;
                        Result will be Hello World.
                    </p>

                </li>
            </ol>

                    <p>
                        <b> Includes:</b> The includes() method is used when you want to check if a string contains a
                        specified string. If it finds the string, the result will be true otherwise it will return
                        false. Also, the include() method is case-sensitive. <br> Example: let word = “Hello World” <br>
                        let result = “ text.includes(“World”); Result will <b> true.</b>
                    </p>
